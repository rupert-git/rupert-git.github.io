    <h1>Cultural reflection, week 1</h1>
    <h3>10 January 2017</h3>

    <p>
      <b>Restaurant mindset:</b> walking in to the bootcamp as a consumer. Paying a price in exchange for an experience that is served to you, that you only passively participate in.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Kitchen mindset:</b> You are actively involved in your bootcamp experience, and you <em>co-create</em> the experience with the others in your cohort.
    </p>

    <p>Many people have the Restaurant mindset before beginning a bootcamp - essentially they see it as paying a certain amount of money for a web development job. That's one of the interesting things about running a bootcamp. While it is first and foremost job-focussed, ie teaching skills that are directly relevant to employment, it is also so much about the experience of learning. Integrating learning (for it's own sake) with people getting employed is not always easy.</p>

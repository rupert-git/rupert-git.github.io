    <h2>Reflection on time and habit techniques</h2>

    <h4>Timebox</h4>
    <p>A Timebox is a maximum amount of time which you allocate to an activity. For example, you might allocate two hours to researching a topic, and when that two hour timebox is up, you would then stop researching (no matter what your progress).</p>
    <p>Timeboxing is common in the Scrum framework. Teams of people timebox their meetings and their work periods, to make time work for them more effectively.</p>
    <p>I like timeboxing because I am prone to focus on details and forget the big picture. Having a timebox on an activity stops me from spending too much time tweaking the fine details when my time could be spent more valuably elsewhere. </p>

    <h4>Starting small</h4>
    <p>One tip that often crops up in time management and habit forming is starting small. In the context of time management, I've employed a variation of this technique for a number of years. Here's my version:
    <ul>
      <li>A big task, eg an essay to write, is looming. </li>
      <li>Motivation is low, because the task looks so big it's hard to know where to start.</li>
      <li>Time for some self-misdirection... start with the mental dialogue <em>I'll just open it up, just to take a quick look. All I need to do is open it and have a quick look</em> </li>
      <li>Having convinced myself, I open the essay and have a look. Success!</li>
      <li>Now for some more misdirection... <em>While I'm here, I may as well just tidy up a couple of things... I'll just a do a couple more quick things. </em> </li>
      <li>1 hour later, still going! They say the hardest part is building up the momentum to start. I like to trick myself into starting, by just doing a very minimal first step, and allowing the momentum to develop.</li>
    </ul>  </p>
